# WBS Magist Case Study

This repository contains my data analysis project for the WBS Coding School Data Science program. The case study focuses on **Magist**, an online marketplace similar to Amazon, using real-world business data provided in the ENIAC project framework.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the Magist marketplace to uncover business insights and support data-driven decision-making. Using SQL and Tableau, I investigated:

- Product sales performance
- Delivery reliability
- Freight costs and delivery speed
- Tech category logistics
- Overall marketplace trends and KPIs

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **SQL** (mySQL)
- **Tableau**
- **Excel** (for intermediate data preparation)
  
-## 🧠 Key Insights

- Tech products account for a significant share of sales but rank 3rd in total items sold.
- Average delivery is **earlier than estimated**, suggesting a **reliable logistics system**.
- Freight costs vary widely across product categories; higher for larger or remote-delivered items.
- Monthly growth and customer reviews indicate positive momentum for Magist.

## 📌 Next Steps

- Deeper analysis of customer satisfaction and retention
- Explore seller distribution by region
- Investigate payment behavior and fraud signals
