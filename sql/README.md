This folder contains structured SQL queries developed for the Magist marketplace case study during the WBS Coding School Data Science program.

Each script addresses a specific business question related to sales performance, logistics, product categories, and revenue trends using the Magist database.

## üß∞ Usage

Each `.sql` file can be run independently in a PostgreSQL environment with access to the Magist database. Some scripts rely on the temporary `tech_categories` table‚Äîrun `tech_categories_table.sql` first if needed.

---

## üìå Notes

- All scripts assume clean, properly formatted data
- Dates are compared using PostgreSQL‚Äôs `DATE_PART()` and `DATE_TRUNC()` functions
- Files are modular and can be adapted to other e-commerce datasets

---

## üìÑ delivery_performance.sql
**Purpose:** Calculates the average number of days delivery was earlier or later than estimated.

FROM orders
WHERE order_status = 'delivered';
```

---

## üìÑ freight_cost_analysis.sql
**Purpose:** Computes average freight cost per order and analyzes cost variation.

```sql
SELECT AVG(freight_value) AS average_freight FROM order_items;
```

---

## üìÑ category_sales_distribution.sql
**Purpose:** Breaks down total items sold per category and calculates percentages.

```sql
SELECT p.product_category_name, COUNT(*) AS items_sold

GROUP BY p.product_category_name
ORDER BY items_sold DESC;
```

---

## üìÑ tech_delivery_vs_nontech.sql
**Purpose:** Compares delivery times and freight cost between tech and non-tech categories.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE WHEN p.product_category_name IN (SELECT category_name FROM tech_categories)
       THEN 'tech' ELSE 'non-tech' END AS category_group,
  AVG(freight_value) AS avg_freight,
  AVG(DATE_PART('day', order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp)) AS avg_delivery_days
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
